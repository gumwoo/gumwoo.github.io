<span class="justify-text">I enrolled in the Department of Statistics at Chonbuk National University in 2020 and have been double majoring in Computer Engineering since 2022. Throughout my studies, I have actively participated in various projects and competitions.

In December 2023, I developed an app and web service called "Delivery Pieces" at the first Open Source Software Idea Hackathon, earning the Grand Prize. Additionally, I presented AI-based forest protection measures under the theme "Forest Protection in South Korea," which won an Excellence Award at the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) Presentation Competition.

In June of this year, I participated in the Hana Power On project conducted by Hana Group, focusing on an AI-based financial health platform for middle-aged and older adults. Recently, I received an Excellence Award at a campus non-curricular program development competition.

Projects I have undertaken include investment strategies through visualization of data patterns in the past of surge and plunge stocks, delivery cost sharing apps through location-based joint orders, simple shopping mall development, and investment stocks decisions through data analysis by companies in the furniture industry.

Currently, the average credit remains high in the 4-point range, with the goal of growing as a back-end developer in the future.</span>
