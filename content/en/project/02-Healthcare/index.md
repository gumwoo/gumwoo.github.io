**Delivery Pieces** is an application aimed at reducing delivery fees through a location-based group ordering system. Users can share the cost of delivery by pooling their orders with others who are ordering the same food, allowing for cost savings and more efficient deliveries.

Key Features and Characteristics of the Project

Location-Based Delivery Fee Sharing System: Users enter the food they wish to order and share the delivery fee with others in the nearby area who are ordering the same items.

Personalized Recommendations: Provides customized delivery recommendations based on users' order history and location data.

Real-Time Participant Tracking: When a delivery order is created, the system tracks nearby participants in real-time and allows users to monitor the delivery progress.

Technologies Used
GPS-Based Location Tracking: Utilizes user location data to quickly connect with other nearby users through a real-time location tracking system.

Cost Sharing Algorithm: An algorithm that calculates the shared delivery fee by dividing the order cost among users, maximizing delivery fee reduction.

Personalized Recommendation Algorithm: Employs machine learning to analyze users' past order data and provide tailored delivery menu recommendations.

Expected Project Outcomes
Delivery Fee Reduction: By distributing the delivery fee among multiple users, it is expected to reduce the delivery cost by at least 50% compared to individual orders.

Efficient Delivery System: With multiple users placing orders simultaneously, delivery efficiency is enhanced, and waiting times are reduced.

Environmental Protection: Reducing the number of delivery trips decreases carbon emissions, promoting a sustainable delivery service.

This project won the Grand Prize at the First Open Source Software Idea Hackathon.
